### Metagenomics-Based Drug Discovery (MBDD)
Our initiative "in your soil your cure" aims to map the bacterial life in the soil in all regions of the kingdom to develop new types of medicines. And the Metagenomics is the knowldge of isolating DNA from soil and it called eDNA. The "e" stands for "Envaromintal DNA".
### Goals & Achivemnts
1. Inclusion of the citizens in this reserach.
2. Road Mapping for the soil isolated all around Saudi Arabia.
3. Isolating more than 400+ Soil Samples all around Saudi Arabia. 
4. Finding out new Drugs that can help us inhibiting the Multi Drugs resistants microbs.
5. Creating the Metagenomics Ambassdors program.

As you can see, we almost covered the map by collecting samples from the north, east, west, south and center of the kingdom.


### Methods
1. Chemicals.
2. Machines.
3. Protocols.


### Protocols 
> ### By using 3 typs of protocols
1. qiGENPowerMax:
2. qiGENpowerDNA.extraction:
3. Cosmid Libraries:


### Samples Prepration
It starts by collecting soil samples to extract the DNA from it, then the processes Starts by using the QiaGen Protocol Step - PCR AND QPCR Step - then the Cosmid Library Step - might after that comes the DNA Sequancing step. 

### Items & equwipments
1. Electroporesis.
2. Waterbath.
3. DNA Sequancing IMG Machein.
4. Nanodrop800.
5. BIO-RAD Gel reader.
6. GEL Ladder (1Kbp) or (100pb)
7. 50ml and 15ml FalconTubes.
8. TissuLyser.
9. Centerfuig.

### problems & other issues
Problems trying to fix in the project & it's always out of stock:
1. Isopropanol.
2. Tris-PH8.
3. Ethanol.
4. Gloves.
5. EDTA.
6. CTAB.
7. NACL. 

### The Protocols additions:
* In the Qiagen kit protocol, we as a metagenomics team (Dr.Mai ALAJaji + Dr.Batool ALMarzoq + Ms. Leena ALMehlisy) added a heating step at 65'C for 10 min then after that the TissuLyser Step comes for also 10 min.
